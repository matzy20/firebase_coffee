A social brand loyalty app to create a closer community for our local coffe shops.

# How to

http-server to get on "http://localhost:8080"

# Walkthrough

At the index page, customer will be vie to become a "feine", in desperate search for some coffee.

Local coffee shop(s) will be listening to the outcry and heed the call for help.

On the /completed route (page: http://localhost:8080/#/completed), each local coffee shop owner will have the power to offer discounts of their choosing back to the "feine" or may take pity and include some wanna be "feines".  

Coffee shop owner types in the discount and it is routed back to the index page. All of the wanne be "fienes" search for the calling and the chosen few get an exited boost of becoming a "feine".

On the link to feine at the bottom of the page will be a gallery of feines (hall of fame for feines to be proud of being in the club).  It will be promoted in a fun way.  

The coffee shop owner will use a rasberry pi connected to AT&T M2X to time lapse their day before, during, and after coffee.  The gallery can be a mix of real pictures and creative memes or stock photos to exemplify how the coffee affects their life.


# Local coffee shops will use technology to create a wider community by developing both a stronger relationship and closer communication with their customers
